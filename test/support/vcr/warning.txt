WARNING: Generating VCR cassettes requires the following in your John Deere
API sandbox account:

- You must have asset creation/deletion enabled in your account.
- You must have at least one organization created.
- The organization must have at least one field.
- The field must have at least one flag.

By default, this setup will use the first organization returned from the API.
If this is not the organization you wish to use, you can create an environment
variable ORGANIZATION_ID which contains the id of the organization you wish to
use. This organization must contain a field, which contains a flag.

This is required because organizations cannot be created via the API, and
fields and flags can be created but not destroyed via the API. We don't create
anything during VCR cassette recording that we can't undo. This process will
leave your sandbox environment in the exact state it was before the cassettes
were generated.

If you don't meet the above requirements, you will be unable to successfully
generate the VCR cassettes.
