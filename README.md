This client allows you to connect the MyJohnDeere API without having to code your own oauth process, API requests, and pagination. 

* Supports both sandbox and live mode
* Simplifies the oAuth negotiation process
* Uses ruby enumerables to handle pagination behind the scenes. Calls like `each`, `map`, etc will fetch new pages of data as needed.

More details coming soon.
